    Try this demo for <a href="https://github.com/hasibzunair/msl-recognition">MSL</a>, 
    introduced in our <strong>WACV 2024</strong> paper <a href="ADD_PAPER_LINK">Learning to Recognize Occluded and Small Objects with Partial Inputs</a>.
    </br>
    MSL aims to explicitly focus on context from neighbouring regions around objects. Further, 
    this also enables to learn a distribution of association across classes. Ideally to handle 
    situations in-the-wild where only part of some object class is visible, but where us humans might 
    readily use context to infer the classes presence.
